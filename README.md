## About the Project
**!! This package is extremely experimental, so use at own risk !!**

`react-hive` is a small library to make handling local state easier when  
using GraphQL endpoints. It's notoriously difficult to marry derived state
from the endpoint with an enhanced local state. `react-hive` is trying
to solve that.

### Features
* Uses recoil under the hood.
* Let's you enhance your schema with local fields.

## Getting Started
### Installation
```shell script
yarn add react-hive
```

```shell script
npm i react-hive
```

### TypeScript

This package is built with TypeScript and supports it out of the box.
